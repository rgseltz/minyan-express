  is_public => boolean
  location_limit_capacity: 10

  Private:
    Consider as a nice to have, if private then user can have as many services at their location

  Seed this data and only choose safe locations

Possible Group Idea. Nice to have
    Group, location, time, and user is the primary_key
      group_id=1, location_id=10, user_id=>Ryan, time=morning
      group_id=2, location_id=10, user_id=>Calvin, time=morning

Possible Time ideas. Idea #3 is good for now.
    Idea 1:
      Static Time Table, create 30min timeslots throught the day
        9am - 930am
        930am - 10am
        1030am - 11am
    Idea 2:
      Dynamic table reserve 10min slot per event
      Create a table that locks in times for user, user must submit time 1st before creating event or filling out other data, we will always check lock table before giving the user the access to create event
    Idea 3:
      No validation user tell us the time and date and we just insert


Event
  id
  start_time
  end_time
  date ? may not if we use timestamp type
  location_id
  current_capacity: the number of people we currently have, default to 0
  max_capacity: default 15, not needed for now


  Consider start_time and end_time, timestamp - 9:30 - 9: 40 (user will dictate the start and end time)
  Constraint make timeslots unique for location to avoid same times
  Constraint ensure that event capacity doesn't exceed
  Every event minimum of 10 to exist

Reserved Event
  user_id
  event_id
  


Constraint
  - User cant attend 2 events at the same time

  User planner table to help us with

  location_id:Airport, start_time: 930, end_time: 940, id: 2
