UserA
UserB

1) Ryan the dev will add safe locations to the Location Table
2) UserA will login and create an event

  a) We will insert into Event table. Aka sql insert
    - Event Table Example: location_id:Airport, start_time: 930, end_time: 940, event_id: 1, current_capacity: 15

  b) UserA that creates event will automatically be added to Reserved Event table. Aka sql insert
    - Reserved Event Table example
      user_id: UserA
      event_id: 1

  c) We will need to increment the current capacity in the Event table. Aka sql update on event current_capacity

3) UserB can go and join reserved events as long as there is room available

  a) Display the events to the user and their time. SQL select from Event table

  b) UserB who wants to join an event, will select the desired event they want to join

  c) As user clicks on desired event. We will add the user to the Reserved Event Table. Aka SQL insert
    Reserved Event Table example
    user_id: UserB
    event_id: 1
  
  d)Increment the current capacity on the event table

4) What if user decides to go back and reserve another event? Solve later. Nice to have.
